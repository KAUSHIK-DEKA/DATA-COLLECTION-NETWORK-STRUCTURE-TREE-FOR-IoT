# DATA-COLLECTION-NETWORK-STRUCTURE-TREE-FOR-IoT
In this Project, a delay.aware time.optimal concurrent.data collection.trees.are proposed to.keep.the overall data.collection duration short. Simulation.findings.demonstrate that the suggested concept can.significantly cut down on.delays in concurrent.data.collection processes.
